The critique point that *Infrastructural Utopia Tower* seeks to emphasize on, is the way our modern society has become significantly reliant on infrastructures and automated systems. For a modern human, infrastructure has become second nature. Without infrastructure, humankind would think it has been placed in the wilderness.

One of the concerns that infrastructure seems to have, is how humankind attempts to apply it almost everywhere. Advances in technology only increased this human capability. Infrastructure is mean to built in technological environments. We are affected by it, most of the time without without even noticing. Hundreds of wires pass through walls, dozens of pipes are laid beneath us, and an unknown number of radio frequencies pass through our bodies. All this illustrates infrastructure’s overwhelming presence, yet, it is cleverly engineered to remain unnoticed.  

“Infrastructure everything” - is a slogan that is subconsciously ingrained in almost every modern human being. “Infrastructural Utopia Tower” is an infrastructure, the way it was built reflects this. Its original idea was based on an utopian model, it was meant to stand on its own, identical to its ideal model. This did not happen, and the existence of this idea did not go beyond a 3D model on an LCD screen. What has been realized however, is it is anti-utopian counterpart - an infrastructured tower. A breeding ground for humankind to apply the ability to infrastructialize as much estate that nature can provide. The outcome is an anti-utopian looking tower that reflects this human characteristic.

This piece also touches on government surveillance. Surveillance however, is not made possible without it's underlying framework - infrastructure. When an infrastructure is built, one should not wonder why someone takes advantage of it. It is a system designed to remain hidden to its intended users, yet still manages to remain manipulable. Infrastructure is meant to be controlled and manipulated, this aspect frequently remains unnoticed since the root *infra* - means closed.

The tower was meant to proclaim digital freedom, a tool aimed at maintaining a free democratic society. But digital technologies like internet, arguably, are one of the most manipulable infrastructures that humankind has every built. Today like never before, someone can control the outcome of something that is located on the other side of the globe, or know everything about the individuals he is surrounded with. We are all part of a grid of infrastructures that provide us with resources, commodities, and sustainable living conditions. Even in the most remote places on Earth, infrastructures consist of satellites that fly above our head. Digital technologies are crucial in allowing these infrastructures to function as efficiently as possible.  

The question that has to be asked is whether infrastructures can be used as means for maintaining freedom. Is there a point where freedom can become instrastructialized given the increase in our reliance on technologies? If our living conditions can be provided through infrastructure, can freedom be served in a similar manner to how tap water is? If infrastructure is so unnoticeable, what is the truth that it hides from us?
